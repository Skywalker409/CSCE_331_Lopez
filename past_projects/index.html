                    <p>
                        This project was done my sophmore year of collage at Texas A&M university. Spring of 2024 the class was 
                        based on developing tools to take Microprocessors to the edge. At the end we spent a 3 lab long session to 
                        develop a driver through a FPGA board to show how we can read and write values in any electronic device.

                <p>
                    In Spring 2024 I developed a CPU engine that can read values form both cache and registers and compute simple
                    mathematical equations. It was quite awesome to see how the design was implemented to develop this 
                    computer and really deepend the understanding of how coding and computer computation plays hand in hand.
