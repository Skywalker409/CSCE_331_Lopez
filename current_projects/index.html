                        For my 331 class at <a style="color: rgba(79, 79, 228, 0.734);" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html"> Texas A&M University</a>, I am to learn the developments of how
                        to effectivly build a website. Software engineering is not really my taste for computer science. 
                        I more really like the optimizations of systems and seeing just how fast I can make something, but making
                        a website is fun at its own times. It also has many great potential opportunities that have been unknow n to me.

                    As part of my first website assignment in my 331 class mentioned above. I am to create a website that was generated by
                    an AI bot. For my i will use Open AI's model of Chat GPT 4mini. (Cause i aint paying for the big boi).
