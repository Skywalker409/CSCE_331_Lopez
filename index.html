               <h1>About Me: </h1>
               <p >Howdy! I'm a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University and part of the Class of 2026 "Ey Ey Ey WHOOP"! I've been driven by my passion for
                 knowing how things work! As a kid I always felt as though computers were magic, so i naturally explored
                  the world of computer Engineering. From building CPUs in Verilog on FPGA boards to developing front-end 
                  applications for peer-tutoring platforms, I thrive on taking on great challenges and turning them into massive personal growth.

               </p>
               <p>
                I pride myself on my work load, and I always try to one up myself every year. Currently my workload consists of 18 credit 
                hours of 300 and 400 level engineering classes. On top of that I work at Texas A&M's IT department for 27 hrs/week. Finally I push 
                myself physically by being on the<a style="color: rgb(108, 108, 244);" href="https://www.instagram.com/tamucrew/"> A&M Rowing team</a>. Rowing being considered 
                one of the <a style=" color: rgb(123, 123, 241);" href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/athletics/definitive-ranking-10-most-exhausting-sports-in-the-world"> top 10 intensive sports</a>, I got my work cut out for me. 
                I never backdown from a good challenge so long as it leads to my growth as a person or engineer. 
               </p>
               <p>
                I’ve gained hands-on experience in a variety of areas, including circuit design, microcontroller
                 programming, and signal processing. Whether I’m troubleshooting technical issues in the IT department, coding in C++
                  and Python, or collaborating with teammates on larger projects, I’m always eager to learn something new and push the 
                  boundaries of what’s possible.
               </p>
                
                <p>
                When I’m not immersed in projects or studying or crew, you can find probably sleeping. In the rare case in which im free
                I love to spend my time with close friends who never left me when the going got tough. Truly I am blessed to have the Lords 
                strength within me, and my friends backing me.
