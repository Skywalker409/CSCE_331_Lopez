                        For my 331 class at Texas A&M University, I am to learn the developments of how
                        to effectivly build a website. Software engineering is not really my taste for computer science. 
                        I more really like the optimizations of systems and seeing just how fast I can make something, but making
                        a website is fun at its own times. It also has many great potential opportunities that have been unknown to me.

                    As part of my first website assignment in my 331 class mentioned above. I am to create a website that was generated by
                    an AI bot. For my i will use Open AI's model of Chat GPT 4mini. (Cause i aint paying for the big boi).
